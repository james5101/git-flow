## Git Flow Workflow Overview
Gitflow Workflow is a Git workflow design that was first published and made popular by Vincent Driessen at nvie. The Gitflow Workflow defines a strict branching model designed around the project release.  

Gitflow is ideally suited for projects that have a scheduled release cycle. It assigns very specific roles to different branches and defines how and when they should interact.
